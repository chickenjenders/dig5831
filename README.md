Artist statement: In the age of AI, there isn't much holding people back from getting into all kinds of new hobbies and interests. Anyone can use AI to create amazing images for graphic novels, interactive narrative fictions, and video game art inspiration. For my project intention, I wanted to show how AI image generation can be used to aid in the use of game development. Personally, I have a very deep interest in creating my own indie horror game, but understand I have several areas I am lacking in to be able to do so, or at least to do so without extreme amounts of work. One of these areas is creating the assets and style of the game I imagine in my head. AI image generation is an amazing tool for somebody like me to be able to see their visions come to life. There are many styles in which images can be generated which can suite almost any art style used in games. In this project, my aim was to show stills from what would look like game play of a pixel style horror game. These are the pictures that would be displayed on a game page somewhere like Steam or Itch.io to show what playing the game looks like. I wanted the style of the game to be consistent and as believable as possible. The game should look like a horror game and keep up similar visuals to continue to look like the same game is being played in each picture.The story of the game is simply depicted as a police woman who is investigating a murder, and I intended for this to be obvious from the selected images. Ultimately, I wanted to show how AI image generation can be used for people to extend their interests into projects and prove the consistency in styling that is obtainable from even the most simplistic tools in AI image generation. Although these images are not necessarily usable in game development as assets, they provide the ability to see exact inspiration and reference for people to use in such creations. Many people may be against such implementation, but it is exciting from my perspective to make game development more obtainable to people who want to create their own game art but are not so artistically inclined. It is also just really cool to see a visual depiction of a game or story that I thought of be created so quickly and creatively.
